    <h1>My Family</h1>
    <h3>My Parents</h3>
    <p>My parents are currently retired. My mom used to be a waitress. My dad was teaching 
        the last few years. Currently, my dad's life consists of doing whatever silly projects my mom wants done
        in our backyard.
    </p>
    <h3>My Siblings</h3>
    <p>I have three sisters who are all older than me. My oldest sister, Karen, is a pharmacist who works for the VA in North Carolina. My middle sister, Michelle, is a teacher at AIMS elementary.
        She recently got her master's degree from the Citadel. My youngest sister, Morgan, just had her first baby. She is married to a doctor in the Air Force. She used to play roller-derby for
        the Washington DC roller-derby team. 
    </p>
    <h3>My Dogs</h3>
    <p>My dogs are the best. Zoey is my oldest dog. She is about eight years old. She is a beagle/terrier mix. We adopted her from the SPCA on October 7th, 2009.
        I like to call her "Scruffy" because she grows an adorable beard. Freddy is my younger dog. He is a corgi. He was born
        on February 5th, 2014. I got Freddy on April 5th, 2014. He is a good dog. Freddy likes to shed all over the place and to run in the water at the beach.
